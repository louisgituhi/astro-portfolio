## Start of 2026

Hello, I am Louis, as you may already know. I have always wanted to write my own blog since campus, 
and I am glad that this year I finally get to do it.

Having a blog page also allows me to say **“This is going on my blog”** — if you get the reference 😄.  
It feels good to have a space where I can write about things I care about and share my experiences.

I’m hoping to get much better at expressing my thoughts clearly and structuring my writing better over time.

This year, I’ve decided to go all in on the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language — more on that later.

I also want to do more cycling. I had a blast doing it last year (2025) with my friend.  
And yes… I’m finally planning my **first ever hike**
